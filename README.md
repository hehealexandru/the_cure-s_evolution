# The evolution of 'The Cure'

Welcome to the visual and interactive journey through the iconic history of post-punk band, The Cure. This web project aims to provide a detailed insight into the evolution of the band from its formation in **1976** to the present day.

## About the Project

This website was created out of a passion for The Cure's music and a desire to share with others the impact and transformations of the band over time. It is a tribute to the unique sound and cultural influence The Cure has had on the music world.

## Web Structure (HTML)

The site structure is built using **HTML5**, ensuring a solid and accessible foundation. We implemented a clear hierarchy of content using semantic elements such as:

- `<header>` for site introduction and navigation
- `<nav>` for the main menu
- `<main>` for main page content
- `<section>` for segmenting content into logical blocks
- `<article>` for individual articles
- `<footer>` for contact and copyright information

These elements contribute to an intuitive navigation experience and facilitate accessibility for all users.

## Styling (CSS)

The visual layout of the site is defined by **CSS3**, using advanced techniques to create an aesthetic and responsive design. Methods used include:

- **Flexbox** for a flexible and adaptable layout
- **Grid** for complex structuring of elements
- Media Queries** for adaptability to different screen sizes
- **Animations and transitions** for adding dynamism to user interaction

Styles are modularized and well organized for easy maintenance and future expansion.
